* Recipi
  Recipi is a personal web server to store recipes and generate shopping lists
  with Wunderlist.

  I started this project to become more familiar with a variety of
  technologies. I've tried to keep notes from my trials and tribulations
  throughout the project. You can find these notes in
  =resources/docs/README.org=.
